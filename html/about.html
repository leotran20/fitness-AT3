                <h3>About ML Strength</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>We are a Brisbane based company with clubs at Ashgrove, Brisbane City, Chermside, Graceville and
                    Westlake.
                    We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of the fitness industry.
                    ML Strength are Australia’s newest brand in health and fitness, with gyms opening throughout the
                    Brisbane metropolitan area.
                    Our gym world does not include the annoying telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms speak
                    for themselves, our members do our marketing. We believe that word of mouth has way more credibility
                    than something that a marketing machine dreams up.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Gyms</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>You are always welcome to look through any of our
                    gyms at your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever. With hard-selling ‘health club’ sales
                    consultants hustling you on every corner, we pride ourselves on being a refreshing change from that.
                    Our ‘no obligation, no pressure’ attitude is clearly evident with our $10 CASUAL visit rate.
                    We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm with our
                    valued members. Our gyms have an old school feel with a new school attitude!

                <h3>Owner's Philosophy</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Hi, my name is Maurice Lidman and my background is in boxing. I competed as an amateur in my early
                    years and now like to share my knowledge and expertise as a coach. It is not unknown for me to jump
                    into the ring as your sparring partner.
                    For over three decades Maurice has been involved in the boxing scene. He has competed as an amateur
                    in his early years and now shares his knowledge and expertise as a coach, by running his boxing
                    classes with passion and enthusiasm.
                </p>
